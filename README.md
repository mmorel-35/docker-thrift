# Thrift Docker Image

This is repository is fork of [ahawkins/docker-thrift](https://github.com/ahawkins/docker-thrift) that
does not seem to be actively maintained - see [ahawkins/docker-thrift/pull/22](https://github.com/ahawkins/docker-thrift/pull/22).

The new versions, starting with 0.13 are published as `jaegertracing/thrift`. The older versions are available from the official `thrift` organization e.g. `docker pull thrift:0.9.2`.

> The Apache Thrift software framework, for scalable cross-language
> services development, combines a software stack with a code generation
> engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between
> C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby, Erlang, Perl, Haskell, C#, Cocoa,
> JavaScript, Node.js, Smalltalk, OCaml and Delphi and other languages.
